## App Purpose
I built this basic JavaScript app to be used for learning. Feel free to use this repo to get started with JavaScript. 
<!-- Visit a running demo of this app here: [Dad Jokes App](https://dad-jokes-mz8s.onrender.com) -->

I also used this app in one of my JavaScript courses on Pluralsight. 
You can find my Pluralsight author profile here: [Steve Buchanan on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/steve-buchanan).

## App Architecture
This app consists of:
- HTML 
- Bootstrap CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js 
- Express

## App Deployment 
This app requires a MySQL database. You will need to host the database somewhere. In the repo there are files with SQL code for creating the database, table, and for inserting the jokes. The folder path is dadjokes/setup/createdbandinsertjokes/

- createDBandJokesTable.sql
- insertJokes.sql

I have tested two deployment options for deploying this app. These are:

- This app can be deployed to the free tier on www.render.com with ease using these steps: [Deploy a Node Express App to Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app). 
- This app can be containerized and deployed with ease to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) a cloud managed Kubernetes cluster using these steps here: [Automated Deployments for AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/automated-deployments).
